# Practice Backend

**Practice Backend** supplies up-and-working frontend parts to help you sharpen up your backend abilities and serve as a basis for discussion about design choices.

**This repo is an Angular application for you to run on your machine**. From that point on, the app will guide you through the experience of numerous challanges in building toy-apps. All these expect a backend API, which is where practice and challenge are found for you. Each step details exact API expectations & desired logic, as if you had a product team assisting the development process and splitting the frontend and backend parts between two teams.
